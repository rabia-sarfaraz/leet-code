# Lexicographically Smallest Palindromic Permutation Greater Than Target

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

You are given two strings s and target, each of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that is both a palindromic permutation of s and strictly greater than target. If no such permutation exists, return an empty string.

 
Example 1:


Input: s = "baba", target = "abba"

Output: "baab"

Explanation:


	The palindromic permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "abba" and "baab".
	The lexicographically smallest permutation that is strictly greater than target is "baab".



Example 2:


Input: s = "baba", target = "bbaa"

Output: ""

Explanation:


	The palindromic permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "abba" and "baab".
	None of them is lexicographically strictly greater than target. Therefore, the answer is "".



Example 3:


Input: s = "abc", target = "abb"

Output: ""

Explanation:

s has no palindromic permutations. Therefore, the answer is "".


Example 4:


Input: s = "aac", target = "abb"

Output: "aca"

Explanation:


	The only palindromic permutation of s is "aca".
	"aca" is strictly greater than target. Therefore, the answer is "aca".



 
Constraints:


	1 <= n == s.length == target.length <= 300
	s and target consist of only lowercase English letters.
