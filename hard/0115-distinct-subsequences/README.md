# Distinct Subsequences

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from s.
rabbbit
rabbbit
rabbbit


Example 2:

Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from s.
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag

 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
	s and t consist of English letters.

    if (t.length > s.length) return 0;

    List<int> dp = List.filled(t.length + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
      for (int j = t.length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        if (s[i] == t[j]) {
          dp[j + 1] += dp[j];
        }
      }
    }

    return dp[t.length];
  }
}
```
