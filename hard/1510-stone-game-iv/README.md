# Stone Game IV

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are n stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer n, return true if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return false, assuming both players play optimally.

 
Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).


Example 3:

Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).


 
Constraints:


	1 <= n <= 105

        for i in range(1, n + 1):

            while j * j <= i:
                if not dp[i - j * j]:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break
                j += 1

        return dp[n]
