# Maximize Number of Nice Divisors

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

You are given a positive integer primeFactors. You are asked to construct a positive integer n that satisfies the following conditions:


  The number of prime factors of n (not necessarily distinct) is at most primeFactors.
  The number of nice divisors of n is maximized. Note that a divisor of n is nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of n. For example, if n = 12, then its prime factors are [2,2,3], then 6 and 12 are nice divisors, while 3 and 4 are not.


Return the number of nice divisors of n. Since that number can be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The prime factors of a number n is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals n.

 
Example 1:

Input: primeFactors = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: 200 is a valid value of n.
It has 5 prime factors: [2,2,2,5,5], and it has 6 nice divisors: [10,20,40,50,100,200].
There is not other value of n that has at most 5 prime factors and more nice divisors.


Example 2:

Input: primeFactors = 8
Output: 18


 
Constraints:


	1 <= primeFactors <= 109

        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        if primeFactors <= 3:
            return primeFactors

        if primeFactors % 3 == 0:
            return pow(3, primeFactors // 3, MOD)

        if primeFactors % 3 == 1:
            return (pow(3, (primeFactors - 4) // 3, MOD) * 4) % MOD

        # remainder = 2
        return (pow(3, primeFactors // 3, MOD) * 2) % MOD
```
