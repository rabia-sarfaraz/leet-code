# Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, return the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the average of the values in its subtree.

Note:


	The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.
	A subtree of root is a tree consisting of root and all of its descendants.


 
Example 1:

Input: root = [4,8,5,0,1,null,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
For the node with value 4: The average of its subtree is (4 + 8 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 6) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4.
For the node with value 5: The average of its subtree is (5 + 6) / 2 = 11 / 2 = 5.
For the node with value 0: The average of its subtree is 0 / 1 = 0.
For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
For the node with value 6: The average of its subtree is 6 / 1 = 6.


Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.


 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
	0 <= Node.val <= 1000

  int countNodes = 0;

  int averageOfSubtree(TreeNode? root) {
    dfs(root);
    return countNodes;
  }

  List<int> dfs(TreeNode? node) {
    if (node == null) {
      return [0, 0]; // [sum, count]
    }

    List<int> left = dfs(node.left);
    List<int> right = dfs(node.right);

    int sum = left[0] + right[0] + node.val;
    int count = left[1] + right[1] + 1;

    if (sum ~/ count == node.val) {
      countNodes++;
    }

    return [sum, count];
  }
}
```
