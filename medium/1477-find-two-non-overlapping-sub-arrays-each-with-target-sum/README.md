# Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find **two non-overlapping sub-arrays** of `arr` each with a sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is **minimum**.

Return *the minimum sum of the lengths* of the two required sub-arrays, or return `-1` if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.

```

 

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= arr.length <= 105
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
- 1 <= target <= 108

```dart
class Solution {
  int minSumOfLengths(List<int> arr, int target) {
    int n = arr.length;
    const int INF = 1 << 30;

    // best[i] = index 0..i tak kisi valid subarray ki
    // minimum length
    List<int> best = List.filled(n, INF);

    int left = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    int answer = INF;

    for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
      sum += arr[right];

      while (sum > target && left <= right) {
        sum -= arr[left];
        left++;
      }

      // Previous best ko carry forward karo
      if (right > 0) {
        best[right] = best[right - 1];
      }

      if (sum == target) {
        int length = right - left + 1;

        // [left ... right] se pehle wali
        // non-overlapping subarray honi chahiye
        if (left > 0 && best[left - 1] != INF) {
          int total = best[left - 1] + length;

          if (total < answer) {
            answer = total;
          }
        }

        // Current subarray ko best mein store karo
        if (length < best[right]) {
          best[right] = length;
        }
      }
    }

    return answer == INF ? -1 : answer;
  }
}
```
