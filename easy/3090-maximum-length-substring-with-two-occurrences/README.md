![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a string s, return the maximum length of a substring such that it contains at most two occurrences of each character.
 
Example 1:


Input: s = "bcbbbcba"

Output: 4

Explanation:
The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "bcbbbcba".

Example 2:


Input: s = "aaaa"

Output: 2

Explanation:
The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "aaaa".

 
Constraints:


	2 <= s.length <= 100
	s consists only of lowercase English letters.

        for right in range(len(s)):
            count[s[right]] = count.get(s[right], 0) + 1

            while count[s[right]] > 2:
                count[s[left]] -= 1
                left += 1

            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)

        return ans
