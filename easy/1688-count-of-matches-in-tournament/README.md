# Count of Matches in Tournament

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an integer n, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:


	If the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. A total of n / 2 matches are played, and n / 2 teams advance to the next round.
	If the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of (n - 1) / 2 matches are played, and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to the next round.


Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.

 
Example 1:

Input: n = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: Details of the tournament: 
- 1st Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
- 2nd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
- 3rd Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.
Total number of matches = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.


Example 2:

Input: n = 14
Output: 13
Explanation: Details of the tournament:
- 1st Round: Teams = 14, Matches = 7, and 7 teams advance.
- 2nd Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
- 3rd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
- 4th Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.
Total number of matches = 7 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.
