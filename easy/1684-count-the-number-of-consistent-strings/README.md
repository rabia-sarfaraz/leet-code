# Count the Number of Consistent Strings

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

 
Example 1:

Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.


Example 2:

Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7
Explanation: All strings are consistent.


Example 3:

Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
Output: 4
Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= words.length <= 104
	1 <= allowed.length <= 26
	1 <= words[i].length <= 10
	The characters in allowed are distinct.
	words[i] and allowed contain only lowercase English letters.

                    valid = False
                    break

            if valid:
                count += 1

        return count
